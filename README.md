# Car-Search

**Car Search** Program was created with [Aashi Singh](https://www.github.com/aashisinghh), for Venus Hacks Hackathon at UCI in May of 2022.

## Inspiration

Ever been overwhelmed browsing through multiple sites looking for new or used cars. We decided to make this process easier. All you have to do is put in your criteria and find the best match for the car you are looking for.

## What it does

Given your requirements for any or all of the following: condition, minimum year, model, make, exterior color, city, state, maximum price, category, fuel type, mileage. It finds the best car match that is on sale and outputs the following information: year, make, model, condition, color, mileage, price, the image of the car, and dealership website and location.

## Video Walkthrough

## How we built it

We built this program using the vehicle listings API by [AutoDev](https://www.auto.dev/listings/getting-started). We used python to store and display the information from the API. We used repl.it, to build our program.
